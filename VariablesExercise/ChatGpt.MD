In Agile methodologies, there isn't a strict or one-size-fits-all ratio of developers to QA (Quality Assurance) professionals. The optimal ratio can vary based on factors such as the size and complexity of the project, the skills of the team members, the nature of the application, and the specific needs of the development process.

However, some general guidelines or common practices include:

1:1 Ratio: In some cases, teams may aim for a 1:1 ratio of developers to QA professionals. This ensures that there is sufficient testing capacity to thoroughly validate the developed features.
2:1 Ratio (Developers to QA): Another common approach is to have two developers for every QA professional. This can work well for projects where rapid development is crucial, and quick feedback from testing is needed.
Cross-Functional Teams: In Agile, the emphasis is on cross-functional teams where members have diverse skills. This means that team members, including developers and QA professionals, collaborate closely throughout the development process. The goal is to have a shared responsibility for quality.
Flexible Resource Allocation: Agile teams often have the flexibility to adjust the ratio based on the current needs of the project. For example, during a sprint with heavy development tasks, more developers may be needed, while during a testing-focused phase, additional QA professionals may be allocated.
It's important to note that the emphasis in Agile is on collaboration and communication rather than fixed ratios. Teams are encouraged to be self-organizing and adaptable to the specific needs of their project. Regular retrospectives and feedback loops can help teams adjust their approach based on their experiences and continuous improvement efforts.
